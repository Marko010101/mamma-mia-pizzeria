- The folder structure follows a feature-based approach. Within the 'features' directory, we have 'cart', 'menu', 'order', and 'user' folders, each containing relevant content. Adjacent to the 'features' directory, we have a 'service' folder for APIs, a 'ui' folder for reusable components, and a 'utils' folder for helper functions.

- project is using react router for routing and creating SPA.
